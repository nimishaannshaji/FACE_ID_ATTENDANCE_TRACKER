# FACE_ID_ATTENDANCE_TRACKER
Face Recognition Attendance System automates attendance marking by detecting and recognizing students' faces using a webcam. It stores attendance data in a CSV file and provides real-time feedback through text-to-speech, including whether the student is on time or late. The system also allows users to upload student images for recognition.
